SFTP Plugin
===

For now just supports downloading, but the uploading feature will come soon, and it is easy to add if someone want to contribute, most of the code allow to implement uploading with no more complication.

This plugin is build on top of [JSch](http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/ "In case you want to be curious") library.

Easy Use

There is a base Object `JJsftp` that should be initialized with the `host`, `user` and `password`
```
var myVar = new JJsftp("host", "user", "password");
```
